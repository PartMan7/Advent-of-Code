This is a compilation of all the solutions I've had so far for each day of the Advent of Code, 2020. To run the code, use ``node index.js``.

I have attempted to optimize my code, and I'm seriously proud that my solution for #13 can run in under 0.03 milliseconds.

Current speedblocks: #15, #17, #11, #14, #9, #7

If you simply wish to run each day exactly once, set ``'once-each'`` to `true` in the options at the top of index.js. If you wish to run individual solutions, set ``'test'`` to the days that you wish to solve - you may use a single integer or an array.

Contributions that improve efficiency are gratefully welcomed.

Current speeds can be seen [here](SPEEDS.md).
