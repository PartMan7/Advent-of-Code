This is a compilation of all the solutions I've had so far for each day of the Advent of Code, 2021. To run the code, use ``node index.js``.



If you simply wish to run each day exactly once, set ``'once-each'`` to `true` in the options at the top of index.js. If you wish to run individual solutions, set ``'test'`` to the days that you wish to solve - you may use a single integer or an array.

Contributions that improve efficiency are gratefully welcomed.

Current speeds can be seen [here](SPEEDS.md).
